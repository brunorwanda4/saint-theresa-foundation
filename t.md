## 1. Understanding the Project

The **Sainte Thérèse Foundation** is a faith-driven nonprofit that wants:

- A **professional, humanitarian-style website** like [Interpeace.org](https://www.interpeace.org/)
- To **present its vision, mission, activities, leadership, and impact**
- To **attract partners, donors, and community engagement**

So, the site is **mostly informational** (no heavy dashboards at first), but with potential to expand (digital health services later).
